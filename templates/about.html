								<h2>What does the UP Fund do?</h2>
								<p>We provide Yale students a rigorous investment curriculum, the opportunity to practice what they learn, and the mission of using returns to finance community development initiatives in New Haven. After completing our security analysis course, taught through the Investment Management Club at the Yale School of Management, our members have access to supplemental materials and platforms to explore investment even outside of stock picking.  Members pitch investment ideas to the team as a whole, and we collectively decide how to allocate the fund’s capital.  Our outreach team then uses the returns from our investments to finance community development initiatives in New Haven.  We combine investment education with community development so that students may prepare for careers in asset management while bettering the community.</p>
								<h2>Who else does this?</h2>
								<p>Student investment clubs are no new idea, but we are the first to address the two major issues that cause most to fail, and we are the only student investment club in the country* to use our returns for community development initiatives.</p>
								<p>The average student investment club fails for two reasons: a lack of good research practices and a lack of commitment. We address the first by providing our members with a structured and proven curriculum taught in partnership with MBA candidates at the Yale School of Management.  In addition, we have compiled a set of resources available to our members so that they may practice and back-test quantitative strategies before pitching them. Our new members will practice trading in a fake portfolio during their training period so that they have some feel for the process by the time they pitch ideas for the portfolio.</p>
                                <p>Many investment clubs suffer from a lack of member commitment. Students lose interest when their work doesn’t make a difference. All of our members are on a mission not only to develop the knowledge of asset management but also to benefit the New Haven community through their efforts. Because our returns go directly to our nonprofit partners, our members see first hand the payoff of their effort.</p>
                                <p class="footnote">*This is to the very best of our knowledge. We searched long and hard to find organizations that do what we do, but we were unable to find a single one to fit the description.</p>
                                <h2>So what’s next?</h2>
                                <p>Over the past year, our founders have been working tirelessly to lay the groundwork for the UP Fund.  They have developed a close advisory board of professors, investment professionals, and community leaders who have helped set the vision and roadmap for the organization. They have confirmed the investment curriculum in partnership with Yale SOM and have ensured that demand exists among students on Yale’s campus for such an opportunity.  The final step for making the UP Fund come to life is seeding the fund.</p>
                                <p>We estimate portfolio growth of 6% per year, and we hope to make $10,000 - $20,000 available in money to finance partnerships each year.  Reinvesting 2% to fight inflation means that we are shooting to raise between $250,000 and $500,000 for this portfolio.  </p>
                                <p>The great new is that you can help the UP Fund come to life!  Your donation can help bridge investment education on Yale’s campus and community development in New Haven, and all donations are tax deductible.</p>
